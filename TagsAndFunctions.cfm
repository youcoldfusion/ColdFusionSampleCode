There are a lot of functions and tags which are there in Adobe ColdFusion and Lucee.
It is not manadatory to use all the functions and tags.If we want to develop any functionality of
an application,we need to check the existing functionality.If any tag and function has been used in
the application we can use it with better code.It is simple like html to use to develop any applications quickly.
